# Bayesian Logistic Regression model for predicting songs' popularity based on Spotify Web API's audio features
Starting from classical inference, Bayesian inference moves one step forward, in the sense that now the parameters that generate observable data are no longer consideren unknown but fixed. Such parameters are indeed thought as random, and thus they can be modeled by an appropriate probability distribution. 
In this paper, several tools of Bayesian analysis will be implemented on a real set of observed data. 
The dataset includes audio features evaluated for some past decade's songs and made available via the official Spotify Web API
